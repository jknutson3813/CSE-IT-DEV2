we have set PHP requirement to 5.6 because manual installation doesn't work on php 5.5. Gives syntax error.
5. Check "PS_CIPHER_ALGORITHM" in database. It should be by default set to "2" in order to generate "_PHP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_" with openssl. If it's value is changed, then check how to generate _PHP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ in install/model/install.php
6. While installation on PHP 5.6 script throws error i.e Composer detected issues in your platform: Your Composer dependencies require a PHP version ">= 7.4.0". So we have set PHP version to 7.4.0 in info.xml.(in version 1.4.0) and also in point 4 on hovering over the download link text, it is mentioned that 'This version requires php 7.4 and higher'.
