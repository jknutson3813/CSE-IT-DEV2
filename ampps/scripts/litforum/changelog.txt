my little forum changelog

20220803.1 (2022-08-03)
-----------------------

- feature: support the upload of WebP-images
- change: semantic HTML-elements on several places and modern CSS-rules (flexboxes instead floating boxes here and there)
- fix: remove outdated query partsthat tried to access column mlf2_entries.email_notifications
- fix: ensure, that su√≠gnatures are reliably positioned under all content of a forum entry
- fix: putting the cursor into the empty search field in the page header and pressing [Enter] led to a PHP warning
- fix: (partially) When classifying entries in locked threads the get unlocked sometimes, happens more seldom now but there is a remaining corner case to inspect
- fix: wrong order of altering the column mlf2_userdata.user_email, defining the unique-key for this column before changing its charset to utf8 (without 'mb4') leads to the error of a to long index in some MySQL-versions
- fix: remove multiple definitions of unique indexes for the columns mlf2_userdata.user_name and mlf2_userdata.user_email in the installation and update scripts, the indexes does not break the structure but they are superfluous

20220529.1 (2022-05-29)
-----------------------

- feature: show an icon to admins and mods for entries that are not classified as ham or spam, if spam detection service B8 or Akismet is activated
- change: first overhaul of the main section of forum pages, affects mainly the main views (thread listings) and the administration start page
- fix: when deleting a user delete also the notification switch in the entries table, normally we use the subscriptions table for this but in forums with entries that was handled with the old subscription handling it may be possible, that there are old subscriptions for registered users left

20220517.1 (2022-05-17)
-----------------------

- fixed: the feature inactivity notification sent an unlimited number of e-mails, what caused the project domain to get blacklisted; to prevent this for external forum operators, the number of e-mails is now limited to 5 per daily action
- fixed: because of the fixed height of the page header the user menu was inaccessible on narrow viewports since the change from XHTML 1.0 to HTML (5)
- the column `mlf2_userdata.user_email` was to large for using an index with charset utf8mb4 on MySQL 5.5 and 5.6, reset it to charset utf8 (3 byte chars only)

2.4.24 (2020-10-12)
-------------------
- fixed: broken layout of the links to the RSS-feed of a single thread in thread.inc.tpl and thread_linear.inc.tpl
- fixed: unintended text-transform: lowercase; for the link to top of the page in the options of an entry
- added: add classes for the user type to the thread tree below the entry in the single-entry-view

2.4.23 (2020-09-30)
-------------------
- fixed: wrong formatting of the link for a threads own RSS-feed, got broken by the work on formatting the RSS-links in the page footer
- fixed: the non-English and non-German strings for the to-top-of-page-links had a broken comment part
