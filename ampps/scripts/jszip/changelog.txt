### v3.8.0 2022-03-30

- Santize filenames when files are loaded with `loadAsync`, to avoid ["zip slip" attacks](https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability). The original filename is available on each zip entry as `unsafeOriginalName`. See the [documentation](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/documentation/api_jszip/load_async.html).
