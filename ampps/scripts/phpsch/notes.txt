9. In version 2.7.2, while manual installation we have imported the sql files manually in the database in following sequence :
	a)/database_schema/full-install.sql (only keep SET foreign_key_checks = 0; remove all the database creation entries as we create database manually.)
	b)/database_schema/sample-data-utf8.sql
This manual method is mentioned in {PATH TO BOOKED}/readme_installation.html as well(Follow steps written in 'If you have database creation privileges in MySQL' section to import databases manually). 
(We used this method because the script installer had an issue. Check if installer works in next version. Still same issue persists in script installer in version 2.7.4 and in 2.7.7 as well).
