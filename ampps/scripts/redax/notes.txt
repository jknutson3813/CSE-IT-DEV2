1) download the "Lite" package.
2) Download the Upgrade SQLs from download page and put it on "updates" folder. Also add [[dbprefix]] in the sql statements.
3) As sql file changes in upgrade we need to make version changes into upgrade.php for sql_import
4) We have disabled upgrade from 2.2.0 as we need to change config file. Please check if it is required in next version as well. If not required, then make min_require as 2.2.0.
5) PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://redaxscript.com/documentation/basics/requirements-1002
6) Though script installer(i.e in includes/Installer.php) in manual installation sets default timezone as 'Europe/Berlin', we set value of 'zone' as 'America/New_York' in sql `[[dbprefix]]settings` table, as the articles and posts go in future posting if we keep 'Europe/Berlin' as timezone.
