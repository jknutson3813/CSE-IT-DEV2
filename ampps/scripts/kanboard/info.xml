			<li><b>Simple</b> : There is no fancy user interface, Kanboard focus on simplicity and minimalism. The number of features is voluntary limited.</li>
			<li><b>Visual and clear overview of your tasks</b> : The Kanban board is the best way to know the current status of a project because it's visual. It's very easy to understand, there is nothing to explain.</li>
			<li><b>Search and filter tasks</b> : Kanboard have a very simple query language that offer the flexibility to find tasks in no time.</li>
			<li><b>Single dashboard for all projects</b> : Get all important information in one place, your projects, you calendar, your assigned tasks and subtasks.</li>
			<li><b>Work in team or alone</b> : Kanboard is designed for small teams but you can also work alone. For each project, you can add members and project managers with more privileges.</li>
			<li><b>Tasks, subtasks, attachments and comments</b> : Break down a task into subtasks, estimate the time or the complexity. Describe your task by using the Markdown syntax. Add comments, documents, change the color, the category, the assignee, the due date.</li>
			<li><b>Automated actions</b> : Don't repeat yourself! Automate your workflow. Stop doing again and again the same thing manually. Change automatically the assignee, colors, categories and almost anything based on events.</li>
			<li><b>Swimlanes</b> : Swimlanes are horizontal separations in your board. You can divide the board into several sections to manage software releases or anything else.</li>
			<li><b>Gantt charts</b> : Visualize the timeline of your projects. Allocate resources effectively. Plan your projects in minutes.</li>
			<li><b>Analytics and reports</b> : Analyze and improve your workflow by using the cumulative flow diagram or the burndown chart. Visualize the lead and cycle time of your projects.</li>
