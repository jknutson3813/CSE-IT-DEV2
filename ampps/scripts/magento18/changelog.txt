Magento Open Source 2.2.11 Release Notes

This release (Magento 2.2.11) marks the final supported software release for Magento version 2.2. Magento 2.2 will no longer receive security updates or product quality fixes now that its support window has expired.

Magento Open Source 2.2.11 offers platform upgrades and substantial security changes. This release includes 24 functional fixes and enhancements to the core product and 30 security enhancements.

Magento 2.2.11 has not been tested with PHP 7.1. PHP 7.1 reached EOL (End of Life) on December 1, 2019. We recommend updating your deployment to a supported version of PHP.
Functional fixes

In addition to security enhancements, this release contains the following functional fixes.
Cart and checkout

    Administrators with appropriate but restricted privileges can now view the list of CMS pages at Content > Pages. Previously, Magento displayed this error: You cannot define a correlation namestore_table more than once.

    A shopping cart that contains items no longer displays a subtotal and order total of zero when the Clear Persistence on Sign Out setting is disabled and the Redirect Customer to Account Dashboard after Logging in setting is enabled.

CMS content

    You can now upload a video from the WYSIWYG editor.

Configurable products

    You can now add new options with new images to an existing configurable product. Previously, when you clicked Save, Magento threw an error and did not save the new variations.

    Simple products no longer disappear from the Admin configurable product list when you set the product quantity to 0.

    Out-of-stock configurable product options are now listed as expected on the storefront when the Display Out of Stock Products setting is enabled on Admin > Store > Configuration > Inventory > Stock Options.

Inventory

    You can now save an edited product when max_sale_qty is set to the Magento default value. GitHub-23319

Import/export

    Magento now adds newly imported images after previously imported ones. Previously, Magento added these most recently imported images randomly.

    The import process now maintains custom option prices that were assigned to different websites and scope before import. Previously, after import, these custom option prices were set to the default scope values.

    Magento now correctly processes product prices during export when the All Store Views scope is set. Previously, the logic for updating the price of custom options in non-default websites was missing when the Catalog > Price setting was set to Website.

Indexing

    The POST /V1/products/tier-prices endpoint now considers account indexer mode as expected.

Infrastructure

Magento 2.2.11 has not been tested with PHP 7.1. PHP 7.1 reached EOL (End of Life) on December 1, 2019. We recommend updating your deployment to a supported version of PHP. See Magento 2.2 technology stack requirements for information about supported versions.
Payment methods

    You can now successfully complete an order using Braintree with PayPal when Shipping Flat Rate is activated. Previously, Magento displayed an informative error.

    For orders paid with Payflow Pro, if the Vault Enabled option is set to Yes, Magento now displays accurate stored card information as expected on the order information page.

Persistent

    Guest users can now check out after persistent shopping cart has been disabled. Previously, Magento displayed this error: No cart with such entityId=0.

    Magento no longer creates a persistent cart session for logged-in users when the persistent cart feature has been disabled. Previously, Magento did not empty shopping carts for users when the user logged out.

Sales Rule

    Select All on the coupon list of the Manage Coupon Codes page now works as expected.

Shipping

    Shipping notification emails sent to customers now contain a link to order tracking.

    Magento now displays the correct cost for shipping in the shopping cart when you return to the cart from the checkout page for an order being shipped to multiple addresses.

Search

    Magento no longer throws an exception when search queries contain decimals.

URL rewrite

    Category-specific URL rewrites are now generated as expected when importing and assigning a product to a category.

    A category schedule update no longer unchecks the Use default value setting on the URL key for the store view.

Wishlist

    Wishlists now accurately reflect product availability when a product has been added to a wishlist and then subsequently disabled. Previously, the wishlist displayed these contradictory messages: You have no items in your wish list and 1 item in wish list.

    Products that are deleted from a wishlist from the Admin are now deleted from the storefront wishlist.

Platform upgrades

The following upgrades to core platform components boost platform security and support PCI compliance:

    Magento 2.2.10 now supports PHP 7.2.x (tested with 7.2.21).
    Magento 2.2.10 does not support PHP 7.0.x.

Substantial security enhancements

This release includes the following security enhancements:

    PSD2 compliance for core payment methods
    Fixes for 75 critical security issues
    Significant platform-security enhancements that boost XSS (cross-site scripting) protection against future exploits. This effort is the culmination of several months of concentrated effort on Magento’s part to reduce our backlog of security enhancements.

Core payment methods integrations are now compliant with PSD2 regulations

The European Union recently revised the Payment Services Directive (PSD) regulation with an updated version–PSD2. This revised regulation will go into effect on September 14, 2019 or shortly thereafter, and will significantly affect most payment processing involving credit cards or bank transfers.  See the Magento Forum DevBlog post 3D Secure 2.0 changes for more information on Magento Payment Provider Recommendations and a wealth of links to PSD2 regulation discussions.

This release contains the following major PSD-related changes:

    The Braintree payment method now complies with PSD2 regulations. Its core integration API has been upgraded to the latest JavaScript SDK v3 API, which is a requirement for supporting native Braintree 3D Secure 2.0 adoption. Braintree transactions are now also verified by using the native Braintree 3D Secure 2.0 service.

    Authorize.net now provides the ability, through the cardholderAuthentication request field, to make 3D Secure verification through third-party services such as CardinalCommerce. Starting with this release, Authorize.net accept.js integration will support 3DS 2.0 through CardinalCommerce.

    The Cybersource and eWay payment modules have been deprecated in this release to comply with PSD2 SCA regulation, which took effect on September 14, 2019, or shortly thereafter. Use the official Marketplace extensions for these features instead.

Security enhancements and fixes to core code

    70 security enhancements that help close cross-site scripting (XSS) and remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities as well as other security issues. No confirmed attacks related to these issues have occurred to date. However, certain vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited to access customer information or take over administrator sessions. Most of these issues require that an attacker first obtains access to the Admin. As a result, we remind you to take all necessary steps to protect your Admin, including but not limited to these efforts: IP whitelisting, two-factor authentication, use of a VPN, the use of a unique location rather than /admin, and good password hygiene. See Magento Security Center for a comprehensive discussion of these issues. All known exploitable security issues fixed in this release (2.2.10) have been ported to 2.3.3, 1.14.4.3, and 1.9.4.3, as appropriate.

    The CGI URL gateway in UPS module has been updated from HTTP to HTTPS.The CGI URL gateway endpoint in the UPS module has been updated from HTTP to HTTPS in response to the disablement of the HTTP gateway by UPS in mid-2019. See Magento User Guide for a discussion of using the UPS shipment method. Shipping method configuration settings are described in the Shipping methods.

    The ./bin/magento config:show command no longer fails with a fatal error after you run ./bin/magento app:config:dump. Fix submitted by Keyur Shah in pull request 17993. GitHub-17582

    A new cron.log file dedicated to logging cron-related information has been added to Magento. This new log file reduces output previously sent to the system.log file, making it easier to find non-cron-related information in the system.log file. Fix submitted by Pieter Hoste in pull request 18389. GitHub-17190

    The getHostUrl() method has been updated to reference HTTP_HOST rather than SERVER_PORT. Fix submitted by Luuk Schakenraad in pull request 18595. GitHub-18585

Fix submitted by Mahesh Singh in pull request 20322. GitHub-19609

Backend

    The address form in the Admin order creation workflow has been refactored to improve performance.

    Magento no longer overwrites user-defined option quantities with default values when a customer edits a bundle product from a shopping cart. Fix submitted by Joseph Maxwell in pull request 15905. GitHub-4942

    Bundle special prices are now correctly rounded when you load and resave a bundle product. Previously, when you reloaded a bundle with a special price that requires four positions after the decimal (for example, 78,9473), Magento rounded the price to two decimal places. Fix submitted by magently in pull request 17971. GitHub-17638

    Magento now maintains the correct base price for a bundle product when you add a bundle product in one currency and then add the same bundle product option in a different currency.
