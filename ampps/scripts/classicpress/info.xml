		ClassicPress retains many of the great features of WordPress. However, in addition, it also has these noteworthy qualities :<br /><br />
		<ul>
			<li><b>Improved Security</b> : Concerned about security? ClassicPress has a “security-first” approach. No matter how shiny or exciting a new feature is, if it’s not secure, it won’t be added to the platform.</li><br />
			<li><b>Less Bloat</b> : We believe that powerful does not need to mean code-heavy. We've trimmed unnecessary plugins and features from ClassicPress core, and continue to actively seek smart ways to reduce code bloat.</li><br />
			<li><b>Block-free</b> : Choose the development path that works best for you. With the flexibility and stability that ClassicPress provides, you have the freedom to create a solution that meets your unique needs.</li>
