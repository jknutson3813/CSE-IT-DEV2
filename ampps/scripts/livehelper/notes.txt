1. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://doc.livehelperchat.com/docs/install/
2. We have made small change in lib/core/lhcore/lhupdate.php file given by vendor in 3.14 version because it was giving error on upgrade.
3. If you get .htaccess: Invalid command 'Header', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration on ampps, please enable 'mod_headers' i.e uncomment
'LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so' in httpd.conf.
4. No need to define variable for 'fcm_key' in `lh_chat_config` table as it's same for all installations and is defined in /modules/lhinstall/install.php(Since 3.40).
5. Keep 'site_address', 'trusted_host_patterns' settings blank in settings.ini.php.
