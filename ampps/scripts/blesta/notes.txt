1. We add "admin_login::setup" in the below line in _blesta.php in our package.
Configure::set("Blesta.csrf_bypass", array("admin_login::setup"));

2. We have purposely kept one blank line in "blesta_install.input" and in "blesta_install2.input" files because since version 4.8.0 'port' => '{database_port}' has become compulsory input parameter for install and this value may vary from server to server hence we have kept it blank.

3. Blesta releases Patch for different PHP versions to support ioncube encoding. Kindly check and update in every version.
	if(sversion_compare(sphpversion(), '7.0', '>=')){
		if(file_exists($software['path'].'/patch/php7hotfix.zip')){
			if(!sunzip($software['path'].'/patch/php7hotfix.zip', $__settings['softpath'].'/app/')){
					$error[] = 'Could not unzip the php7hotfix.zip';
			}
		}
	}
*Please note that, Since Blesta 4.6.0 the above patches are needed only if Ioncube version is less than 10.1.0.(We have handled this in install.php)

4. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK: https://docs.blesta.com/display/user/Requirements

5. Json extension requirement added because blesta installer needs json_decode function.
