Bolt 3.7.0
-----------

Released: 2019-11-12. Notable changes:

 - Change: Dropped support for PHP 5.5, 5.6 and 7.0. [#7826](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/pull/7826)
 
This means the minimum requirement for Bolt 3.7 is now PHP 7.1. Because of this,
the default distributions will now include more recent versions of libraries,
providing better support for more recent versions of PHP 7.1 and higher 
out-of-the-box. This is most noticeable with Doctrine, our database library. 

If you're stuck on an older PHP version, you can keep using Bolt 3.6 for the 
foreseeable future.
