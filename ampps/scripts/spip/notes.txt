1. Choose MySQL for type of database.
2. Do not remove sha256.inc.php file we use it for password encryption.
3. In /config/connect.php file in manual installation it doesnt takes "_" for dbprefix and database has it.
4. Check for _jobs 'date' entries. In 3.0.11 we have used regtime. before it was [[queue_watch_date]] etc.
5. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://www.spip.net/en_article6659.html
6. Blank plugin entry "meta" table. It generates after login.
7. In "meta" keep value of langue_site as [[language]], to keep frontend as well in the user selected language.
8. Keep [[language]] in "auteurs" table.
9. `backup_cles` entry generates post login.
10. Kept sha256.inc.php file to add backup compatibility in edit.
11. We have deleted all the folders(except config and IMG) in upgrade as keeping old files results in error when uploading a document in "Edit-->Document" section. Discussion is mentioned here. https://discuter.spip.net/t/error-uploading-documents-post-upgrade/162884/7
12. Keep 'vendor' folder writable as well while manual installation, to avoid warning of 'inoperative .htaccess'.
