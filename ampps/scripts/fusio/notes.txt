1. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://docs.fusio-project.org/docs/installation/ and also check composer.json
2. Make manual installation using CLI because if we install from UI backend doesn't get installed.
   https://docs.fusio-project.org/docs/installation/#manual-setup
3. Also install backend using following command.
	php bin/fusio marketplace:install fusio     
4. We have disable fetching version number in import because it has multiple version specified. Enable it once vendor solves the issue. Propably in next update.
4.SET FUSIO_ENV="prod" in '.env' file, before starting the manual installation.
5. Check and move public/apps/fusio/ from manual to zip(except index.html at public/apps/fusio/index.html) as it is created post execution of command 'php bin/fusio marketplace:install fusio' mentioned in the docs link above in point no. 2. Check the difference with /cache/app-fusio_{{random_string}}.zip. We can compare apps/fusio/ from https://github.com/apioo/fusio-apps-backend/archive/{{Latestversion}}.zip
6. Keep FUSIO_HOST as is i.e FUSIO_HOST="127.0.0.1" in manual installation.
7. Please note, always download 'fusio.zip' from latest version from https://github.com/apioo/fusio/releases as it pre-includes the vendor folder. Don't download the source code zips.
