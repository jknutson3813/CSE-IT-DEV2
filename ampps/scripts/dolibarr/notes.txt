1) Do not provide Username Pass for "Database server - Superuser access" while manual installation. (Not needed now)
2) For data.zip, Zip all the contents from "Documents" folder which installer has ask to create while manual installation.
3) Make it with mysqli not with mysql.
4) Do check "conf.php.example" and "conf.php.old" files for any changes in manual package.

6) Post upgrading from 6.0.5 to 7.0.0, table "facturedet_rec_extrafields" and table "facture_rec_extrafields" are not generated. He will fix it in next version as they are not used in this version. (Confirmed with vendor via email.)
Table "facture_rec_extrafields" is created in 7.0.1, Table "facturedet_rec_extrafields" is still remaining. This is from 6.0.5 to 7.0.x

commande_fournisseur_dispatch_extrafields

table emailcollector_emailcollectorfilter  --- rulevalue` varchar(128) DEFAULT NULL,

ALTER TABLE `[[dbprefix]]commande_fournisseur_dispatch
ALTER TABLE `[[dbprefix]]reception
7) Uncheck 'Make an anonymous Ping '+1' to the Dolibarr foundation server' option while manual installation.
8) Don't exclude the install folder in install.xml, as it is required for features that are installed dynamically on demand of new dynamic features and excluding this directory breaks those. (On vendor request over email). We have already added install.lock file already to softdatadir i.e swrite($__settings['softdatadir'].'/install.lock', '', 1); to prevent accidental installation, as specified in docs.
(Since 16.0.1)
