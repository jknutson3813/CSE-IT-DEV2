WARNING:

Following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:
* Minimal PHP version is now PHP 7.0 instead of PHP 5.6
* The signature of method getNomUrl() of class ProductFournisseur has been modified to match the signature of method Product->getNomUrl()
* Trigger ORDER_SUPPLIER_DISPATCH is removed, use ORDER_SUPPLIER_RECEIVE and/or LINEORDER_SUPPLIER_DISPATCH instead.
* All functions fetch_all() have been set to deprecated for naming consitency, use fetchAll() instead.
* Code standardization: '$user->rights->propale' is now '$user->rights->propal' everywhere.
* Deprecated method set_billed() on shipment and reception class has been removed. Use setBilled() instead.
* Tables llx_prelevement_facture and llx_prelevement_facture_demande have been renamed into llx_prelevement and llx_prelevement_demande.
* Rename MAIN_LIST_ALLOW_NOTES into MAIN_LIST_HIDE_NOTES and rename MAIN_LIST_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NOTES into MAIN_LIST_HIDE_PRIVATE_NOTES
* Rename the substitution for "project label" instead of "project title" in substitution variables
* You must use "$objectoffield" to manipulate the current object inside the formulare of computed custom extrafields instead of $obj/$object.
* Making a global search is sending the parameter using always the name search_all (instead of sometimes sall and search_all)
* The property $url_last_version must be public if defined into module descriptor files;
