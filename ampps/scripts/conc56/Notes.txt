1) Install twice i.e with and without sampledata and give the name of sql file accordingly.
2) Copy the whole /files folder from manual installed with sampledata and then make data.zip (DONT FORGET TO EMPTY the contents of cache folder)
3) Please do not replace timestamp in FileVersions table in sql. (There is no timestamp in FileVersions table)
4) Remove ENVIRONMENT_CACHE from the Config table. Concrete5 generates it.
5) We have excluded the file "config/site_theme_paths.php" during upgrade becuase it has the user's customization and should not be overwritten.
6) Add this line in Config table of both sql for language ('SITE_LOCALE', '[[date_gmt]]', '[[language]]', 0, 0); ( Not required since 5.6.4.0 as languages are not vailable in package itself )
7) PHP7 support was added in version 5.6.4.0 and its mentioned here https://documentation.concrete5.org/developers/introduction/version-history/5640 . So we have removed PHP7 lt condition from info.xml and mcrypt as well to make script compatible with PHP 7.4. Script works on PHP 7.4 ,tested manually as well as with Softaculous.
