			<li><b>Documents and Folders :</b> SeedDMS manages documents and folders very similar to a file system on your hard disk. But it offers much more when it comes to additional meta data like the author, keywords, a description, and arbitrary attributes.
			<br/>Each document has at least one version which is the actual content of the document. Any update will create a new version, while keeping all the old ones.
			</li>
			<li><b>Meta data, Searching :</b> A document is more than a file. It has extra metadata, can have any number of versions, be related to other documents, may even have attached files, has access rights and can be run through a workflow before it is released. The most common document types like PDF, MS Word, MS Excel can be indexed for full text search.
			</li>
			<li><b>Workflow :</b> LetoDMS always had a simple workflow management requesting review and approval before a document is released. Since version 4.0.0 SeedDMS has a fully new workflow engine has been added which allows arbitrary self defined workflows.
