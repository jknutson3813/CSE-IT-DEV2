1) Select Standard New Company without demo data in 'Select Chart of Accounts'

2) install with db prefix which is 0_

3) remove the second data entry from sql ... (demo user)

4) PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : http://frontaccounting.com/fawiki/index.php?n=Main.Installation

5) Change session.inc in our package if there is a change in original package. Frontaccounting was logging out when installed on "HTTP" server hence we have handled this in our code.

6) We have excluded includes/session.inc in upgrade.xml, as the file gets overwritten when new package is unzipped, since by default the value of SECURE_ONLY constant is true, it throws error on 'http' installations i.e 'HTTP access is not allowed on this site. This is unsecure'.
