<ul>
	<li><b>Simple</b>: as few features as possible</li>
	<li><b>flexible</b>: Bugs doesn't decide whether you should think in term of priorities, types of issues, milestones, etc... Instead, Bugs uses a Tags system that you can set up to match your own way of dealing with stuff.</li>
	<li><b>open source</b>: was, is, and always will be.</li>
	<li><b>Multilingual</b>: so your clients can feel at home with it.</li>
	<li><b>Handy</b>: issues can be written in Markdown, commented so you keep the discussion organized, and have print-screens.</li>
	<li><b>Reliable</b>: you get a warning email whenever someone comments, closes or assigns you a bug ticket (unless you did it to yourself, you sick mind).</li>
	<li>Default Assignee per project</li>
	<li>Several roles &amp; privileges: 
	<ul>
		<li>User: can only read the issues in the projects they are assigned to</li>
		<li>Developer: can update issues in the projects they are assigned to</li>
		<li>Manager: can update issues in all projects, even if they aren't assigned</li>
		<li>Administrator: can update all issues in all projects, create users and view administration</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
