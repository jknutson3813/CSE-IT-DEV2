1)script requires two javascript files to be added to 'js' folder i.e CalendarPopup.js and ColorPicker2.js which needs to be downloaded from http://supercali.inforest.com/downloads.php
So before starting manual installation , make the zip by adding these two files in the package. (Not required since 1.1.0)
2)While manual installation , while entering admin details ,enter admin email(not username).
3) We have updated PHP requirement to 7.0.0 in v1.1.0. This is because it was throwing error post manual installation on 5.3, 5.4, etc :
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare mysql_result() in /{PATH}/{TO}/includes/start.php on line 33
