1. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK: https://nukeviet.vn/en/download/CMS/NukeViet-4-5-02.html and also check vendor/composer/platform_check.php(its mentioned that composer dependencies require 7.1.0 so we have kept php version 7.1.0 in info.xml)
(Dependencies now require PHP 5.6 (Checked in the same file and tested the same on PHP 5.6). So reverted back minimum requirement to PHP 5.6 in info.xml as well.
2. Check and verify "act_1", "act_2", "act_3" columns for every checksum value in 'authors_module' table and if there is any change then update it in install.php
3. Remove ftp_user_pass entry from config.global.php and from database config table as it can be created from admin panel --> Configuration --> FTP Configuration. (Confirmed with vendor via email)
4. config_ini.domain.com.php generates on visiting front page and admin URL.
5. Check and Copy /data/config/disable_site_content.en.txt to our package zip.
