== Upgrading notes for 1.39 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.31.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.39 upgrades are below:
* (T278139) Drop PHP 7.3 support in MediaWiki 1.39; require 7.4.3 or higher.

For notes on 1.38.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.39 ===

==== New configuration ====
* $wgAutoCreateTempUser – This configures automatic user creation on page save.
* $wgCopyUploadAllowOnWikiDomainConfig – This configures if administrators can
  use the MediaWiki:Copyupload-allowed-domains system message to define which
  domains can be used with the upload-by-url tool.
* $wgCdnMatchParameterOrder – This can be set to false if MediaWiki is behind a
  CDN that re-orders query parameters. This will make the code that matches
  request URLs to canonical CDN URLs insensitive to parameter order.
* $wgMultiShardSiteStats – This allows you to split site_stats across multiple
  rows. Only useful for very large, heavily edited wikis. (T306589)

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgInvalidUsernameCharacters – This setting now contains the char '>', which
  is now the reserved delimiter for external user names.
* $wgLocalFileRepo – The default serialization method for file meta-data has
  been changed to JSON. You can revert it to PHP by setting the property
  'useJsonMetadata' to false.
* $wgLBFactoryConf – The 'configCallback' flag can now be set to a callback
  function that returns an array with keys to update in $wgLBFactoryConf. This
  can be used to update the database configuration on the fly, e.g. to take
  replica hosts out of rotation.
* $wgDBservers and $wgLBFactoryConf – The DBO_SSL flag in has been deprecated in
  favour of a boolean "ssl" parameter.
* $wgObjectCaches – The 'globalKeyLB' and 'localKeyLB' flags are no longer
  supported.

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgMultiContentRevisionSchemaMigrationStage - This transition flag, deprecated
  since MediaWiki 1.35, has been removed; the data migration is over.
* $wgActorTableSchemaMigrationStage - This transition flag has been removed; the
  data migration is over.
* $wgWikiFarmSiteDetector – This experimental setting has been removed without
  replacement. Use the MW_WIKI_NAME environment variable to specifiy the name of
  the site for which to load configuration. Using the WIKI_NAME environment
  variable for this purpose is deprecated.
* $wgParserCacheUseJson - The ParserCache now always uses JSON serialization.
  Reading old non-JSON cache entries is still supported. The setting had been
  deprecated since 1.36.
* $wgAllowJavaUploads - To allow uploads of JAR files, remove application/java
  from $wgMimeTypeExclusions.
* $wgMaxRedirects – This broken feature was removed, as it never worked as
  intended (T296430).
* $wgElementTiming – This experimental, default-disabled feature has been
  removed without replacement.
* $wgPriorityHints and $wgPriorityHintsRatio – The related experimental feature
  has been removed without replacement.
* $wgIncludeLegacyJavaScript – This flag has been removed, without loss of any
  functionality in this release. Most former "wikibits" functions were removed
  after deprecation in previous releases. The remaining functions, such as
  importScript, are now available unconditionally.
* $wgLegacySchemaConversion - This unused setting has been removed.
* $wgInterwikiPrefixDisplayTypes - This unused setting has been removed.
* $wgMangleFlashPolicy – This is no longer functional, and is now deprecated.
  Users who are somehow still using Flash as a browser extension will be exposed
  to CSRF vulnerabilities.

=== New user-facing features in 1.39 ===
* Optional automatic user creation on page save ($wgAutoCreateTempUser)
* Administrators now have the option to delete/undelete the associated "Talk"
  page when they are (un)deleting a given page. `deletetalk` and `undeletetalk`
  options were added to the 'delete' and 'undelete' action APIs in MW 1.38.
* `{{=}}` is now a wikitext built-in magic word, expanding to `=`.  This is
  conventionally used as an escape mechanism to allow the use of `=` in
  unnamed template arguments.  Defining [[Template:=]] to expand to something
  other than `=` has been deprecated since 1.36, with affected pages put into
  a special tracking category for migration.
* (T284020) Bot passwords are now supported when using the REST API.
