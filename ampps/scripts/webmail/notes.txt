6. UPGRADE GUIDE: https://afterlogic.com/docs/webmail-lite-8/installation/upgrading-instructions
7. We have set min PHP to 7.2.5 because in version 8.8.3 it's composer dependencies require PHP >= 7.2.5
8. db_init.php and migrate.php files included in our package to support migration from 8.8.0 to 9.0.0 Do not delete these files.
9. Download db_init.php from https://afterlogic.com/files/db_init.zip and migrate.php from /dev/migrate.php of the new package and update it's $sPassword = "pass"; as suggested in upgrading notes.
10. We are keeping "SmtpPassword" field blank in mail_servers table because this is a random value and regenerates on saving mail_server config from the admin panel.
11. Check and move files from /data/settings/modules from manual to our zip. (Except Core.config.json)
