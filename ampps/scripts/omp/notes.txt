1)Primary locale english
2)Don't install additional locales
3)client character set -utf8 
connection character set -utf8
database character set-utf8
4)pass encryption (sha1)(default)
5)Select Mysqli in manual installation
6) "enableBeacon" check this option from 1.2.0
7) Always check and modify config.inc.php to the latest and keep installed = Off as it is required in upgrade. Take config.inc.php of manual installation as it has some changes compare to config.inc.php of downloaded package.
8) Min_requirement for upgrade is set to 1.2.0.0 because in OMP version < 1.2.0.0 collation is latin1 and in latest version it is utf8. So it is giving error "Illegal mix of collations" while upgrading to 3.1.0.0
9) PHP REQUIREMENT LINK: https://pkp.sfu.ca/omp/omp_download/
10) We have kept PHP requirement as PHP 7.1.0 in info.xml as there was Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '?' while starting manual installation on PHP 7.0.0. Check if it works on PHP 7.0.0 in next version.(Since 3.1.2.2). Not working on PHP 7.0(checked in version 3.1.2.3).
11) Please check symlinks every time by checking difference in the original zip and ground zip and update in install.php, upgrade.php and clone.php.
12) We have made change in lib/pkp/classes/install/form/UpgradeForm.inc.php because on upgrading 3.2.1.3 version to 3.3.0.3 version was giving error. https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/6703
