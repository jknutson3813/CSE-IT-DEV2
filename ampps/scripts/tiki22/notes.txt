7. we have kept minimum upgrade version to 12.0 as we have tested from 12 only.
8. Post upgrade from 20.0 to 20.1 the columns `lastlogin_date` and `currentlogin_date` are not created. Vendor has told us in mail that it would take long time to rebuild indexes through browser and that, there is a chance that script might timeout, hence indexes are not rebuilt while upgrade, they can be rebuilt later via command line cron as follows:

9. Check and add ('language_admin', '[[admin_language]]'); in tiki_preferences for admin languages
10. Delete "internal_site_hash" entry from tiki_preferences table. It generates again.
11. Important note : Make sure to change version number in upgrade.php under function __pre_unzip() and __upgrade() functions in every major version, since all the old files are to be deleted except the local.php file, which we safeguard and restore. This is mentioned here
