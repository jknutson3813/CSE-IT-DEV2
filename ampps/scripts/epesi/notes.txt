1. We take the data files from the manual and make the epesidata.zip and extract it after installation(remove contents of cache folder and config.php file).
2. Remove the following code from .htaccess
 
#if your server is running php as apache module:
php_value memory_limit "64M"
php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off

Remove the following as well:
"Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN"
Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" 
(because "Internal Server Error" occurred (from version 1.8.2))

3. Remove the INSERTS from following tables from DB tools_whoisonline_users, session_client, session, history

4. 'cache' value for base_notify table remains constant so we do not change it. (since 1.7.0)

5. Timezone as "America/New York" for manual installation.

6. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : setup.php
Script's composer.json requires PHP 7.2.5 since 1.9.1
