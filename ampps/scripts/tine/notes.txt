1. Make manual installation where MySQL is >= 5.7.7
2. While manual installation : "Config Manager" -> Save Config and then move to Authentication/Accounts
3. Create data directory with "tmp" and "files" directory and add respective paths during manual installation.
4. Check and compare data directory everytime with Addressbook/Export/templates/*, Sales/Export/templates/*, Crm/Export/templates/*, Timetracker/Export/templates/*, Calendar/Export/templates/* of original zip. These files should match with "tmp" and "files" directory files.
