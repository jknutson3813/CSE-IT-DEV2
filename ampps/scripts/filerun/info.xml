			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>No import required</b><br/>
					Just like you do with an FTP server, point FileRun to where you keep the files on your server and you will get instant web access to them.
					<br/>
					Want to access your files also by FTP, SMB or WebDAV (server included)? No problem. Upload, download or manage the same files.
					<br/>
					All changes made to the files using FTP or other method reflect via FileRun without delay.<br/>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Send file requests</b><br/>
					File requests allow you to collect and receive files from anyone, right into your FileRun user account, with just a link.
					<br/>
					File requests are ideal for receiving a large file or collection of files, collecting photos after a special event, and requesting submissions from coworkers and clients.<br/>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Guest users</b><br/>
					Collaborate with other people without creating accounts for them.
					<br/>
					Getting feedback on documents, photos or any type of file has never been this easy.<br/>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Your files everywhere</b><br/>
					Access your files from wherever you are using the free mobile apps.
					<br/>
					Sync files from your desktop using the free desktop apps.
					<br/>
					Access via WebDAV. FileRun comes with its own embedded WebDAV server. No server configuration needed.<br/>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Extendable</b><br/>
					PHP web developers can develop plugins for viewing, creating or manipulating files.
					<br/>
					The OAuth2-secured API can be used for programatically interacting with FileRun, or creating more apps for accessing your files.<br/>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Safe</b><br/>
					The automatic file versioning system prevents you from accidentally overwriting existing files.
					<br/>
					Deleted files first end up in a trash folder before they get permanently erased.<br/>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Secure</b><br/>
					Cross Site Scripting (XSS) protection.
					<br/>
					SQL injections protection.
					<br/>
					Session Hijacking protection.
					<br/>
					Brute force login attempts protection.
					<br/>
					The users input is strictly validated to prevent access outside the allowed folders.
					<br/>
					The files can be stored outside the public are of the webserver (ie. outside the "www" folder) so direct access to the files is impossible.
					<br/>
					100% support for HTTPS/SSL.<br/>
