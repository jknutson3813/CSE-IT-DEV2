			<li>Create user accounts with specific privileges.</li>
			<li>Online Editing!</li>
			<li>You can now edit your genealogical data online with HuMo-genealogy. You can even build up an entirely new family tree online, without ever importing a gedcom file. With the editor you can also add custom events, photos etc.</li>
			<li>Gedcom Export!</li>
			<li>You can now export your online HuMo-genealogy genealogical data into a Gedcom file that can be used by other genealogical programs. With version 4.8 you can now also export parts of trees.</li>
			<li>Merge Gedcom files and use the sophisticated merge system to resolve all duplicates</li>
			<li>HuMo-genealogy is compatible with the Gedcom files exported by all major genealogy programs (such as Brothers Keeper, Legacy Family Tree, PAF - Personal Ancestral File, Roots Magic and many more). If you use another program, don't worry - if it complies with the Gedcom standards, HuMo-genealogy will most likely handle it. And in the rare case your program should not classify , all chances are that this can be fixed too. HuMo-genealogy is being constantly developed.</li>
			<li>Your HuMo-genealogy website is easily updated with new material you collected. All that is needed is to upload an updated Gedcom file, read it in - and your site will show the new data.</li>
			<li>New HuMo-genealogy versions are published all the time. HuMo-genealogy is easily upgraded. In just a few minutes you will be up and running.</li>
