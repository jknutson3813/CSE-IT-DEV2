1. We have disabled update as it requires to rename config.php and start over installation again ( which requires admin details). 
2. In version 1.3.7 we have patched functions.php as mentioned here https://github.com/opendocman/opendocman/issues/278 to make script work in subdirectory. As script does not generate base url correctly we have done this, it throws error of 403 Access Forbidden by CSRFProtector!, due to wrong url being generated. Check in next version if script works without patching functions.php file. Also while manual installation we had to enter db details manually in config-sample.php for installation to work correctly.
