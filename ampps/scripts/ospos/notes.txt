1. Have added following code to .htaccess to redirect to public directory :
<IfModule mod_alias.c>
RedirectMatch 301 ^[[relativeurl]]/$ [[softurl]]/public
</IfModule>

Not required since 3.1.1 becuase they have handled this in their package and the code same as below :
(check in all future versions as well). We have removed sconfigure.

# redirect to public page
  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^public$
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{REQUEST_URI}public/ [R=301,L]
  </IfModule>


2. We have not added upgrade in 3.0.0 because there is huge changes in directory structure and its upgrade notes are not properly given. Try to add in next version.

3. Download long name zip for manual installation. (Confirmed with vendor via github issues since version 3.1.0)

4. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://github.com/jekkos/opensourcepos#server-requirements

5. We have changed .htaccess to redirect public folder

6. Please take sql dump after running migrations in manual installation.

7. Upgrade notes are given here https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/blob/master/UPGRADE.txt . Also in every upgrade check upgrade notes in tagged releases on Github as well.
