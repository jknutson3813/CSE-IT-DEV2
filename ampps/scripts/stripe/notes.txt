1. We use __config.php to reset the theme to the previous one if the version is less than 3.0
2. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK: https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/getting_started/server_requirements/ and /vendor/composer/platform_check.php
3. We have disabled upgrade in 4.0.0 because it requires migration with composer. https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/upgrading/#manual
Try to add from next version.
4. Download package through composer because vendor sometimes give large package through their website downloads.

curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

php composer.phar create-project silverstripe/installer {{path to stripe}} {{version}}
5. Keep SS_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE="live" before running the installation command
6. Install with following command as "soft" user from CLI because script has removed it's UI installation since 4.5.0 version.
php vendor/silverstripe/framework/cli-script.php dev/build
7. Add SS_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME and SS_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD while installing manually to define username and password.
8. We have disabled install on windows because symlink issue since 4.4.1
9. We have kept version 4.5.2 in info.xml, because version released was 4.5.2 but however inside admin panel it shows 4.5.1, because they have changed their versioning scheme and its mentioned in the link below. They have different module versions for framework , recipe and cms and in admin panel the version indicator used is of cms which has 4.5.1 version. 
Also we have used 'silverstripe/recipe-cms' version i.e 4.5.2 in composer.lock to import version as 4.5.2, instead of 'silverstripe/cms' which holds version 4.5.1.

10. If you face error on accessing silver stripe admin panel in manual installation, try deleting server's /tmp/silver**** directory multiple times.
11. Take SQL dump after logging into admin panel and delete entries from `LoginAttempt` and `LoginSession` tables.
12. "TempIDHash" and "TempIDExpired" generates on login.
