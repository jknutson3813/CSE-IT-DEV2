1. Install without dbprefix bcoz of it takes dbprefix as prewb_weberp4
2. Time Zone : America/New_york
3. Install with sample data and also without sample data(since version 4.13.1).
4. Dump the sql by command : mysqldump --routines -u root -pmysql web4101 > weberp.sql
5. Copy companies/database folder from manual to companies/softaculous
