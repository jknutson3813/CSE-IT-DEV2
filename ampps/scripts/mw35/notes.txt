################ Untar downloaded tar.gz package on linux server and then make a ground zip. ################

1) Use Storage Engine Innodb. 
2) Use binary database character set.
3) Use the License as "No license footer"
4) Check the language files exists in the /languages/classes/ & /languages/messages/ it should be there with the downloaded zip.
5) We have added "tmpdir" in order to save cache at different locations for each installation to avoid conflicts between them. (v1.27.1)
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual_talk:Upgrading#Shared_server_.2B_multiple_Mediawiki_installations
https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T127127
We have added the following in LocalSettings.php
$wgTmpDirectory = "[[tmpdir]]";
6) PHP REQUIREMENT LINK: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_1.35
7) check "I'm bored already, just install the wiki." and continue in manual install
8) Check visual editor and other extension options in every major update. By clicking "ask me more questions" option. (Just to check)
9) removed inserts from "job" table because it creates entry after page access
10) Keep `content_sha1` value as it is in "content" table because it is same for all installations.
11)we have disable cross upgrade because we were getting following error post upgrading. eb786298294aef346a4e8c9b] 2020-03-27 11:45:10: Fatal exception of type "MWException"
(Reported issue to vendor as well) Check in next version if it resolves.(Got this error while upgrading from 1.31.12 to 1.35.1 so have disabled cross upgrade(i.e changed 'min_require' in info.xml as 1.35.0), check whether cross upgrade works in next version and also change 'min_require'.(Enabled in 1.35.4 and changed minimum requirement to 1.31.0 since cross upgrade is working)
