1. Default Timezone: America/Los_Angeles
2. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK: ../INSTALL and /install/index.php
3. The values for 'cipher', 'mode', and 'options' in lepton.ini.php are hardcoded in /install/save.php, so keep them as it is.
4. Since 4.3.0 2FA has been introduces. Uncheck this and then make the manual installation.
(Since 4.4.0 this cannot be unchecked. Hence to disable 2FA we keep column value of 'tfa' as 'false' in `[[dbprefix]]settings` table in sql. To check this in manual installation take sql dump on installation sucessful page and then, visit admin panel's Menu->Settings->Default Settings and uncheck 'Two factor authentication' and take another dump and compare these two dumps). Since 4.5.0 2FA can be disabled at time of installation by unchecking it.
