<IfModule mod_alias.c>
RedirectMatch 301 ^[[relativeurl]]/$ [[softurl]]/public
</IfModule>
8. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://docs.invoiceninja.com/install.html (Vendor has asked us to keep PHP requirement 7.1 and he will update requirement on his website) and also check /vendor/composer/platform_check.php/ (also check extension list from this file in every version i.e $missingExtensions array and add to our info.xml, if any extension from the array is not present in our info.xml)
9. Release date : https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/releases
10. We exclude logo image path while upgrade i.e public/images/invoiceninja-logo.png since user's custom logo was getting overwritten post upgrade.
