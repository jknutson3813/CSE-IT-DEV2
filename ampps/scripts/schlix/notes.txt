1. Choose "System Timezone" as "America/New_york"
2. install with "Demo - Company profile sample site" sample data
3. Move all files and folder of web folder except config.inc.php and /web/{{site-id}}/cache/sitemap.xml to package. sitemap.xml file generates on visiting Tools/sitemap in admin panel.
4. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://www.schlix.com/documentation/v2/system-requirement.html
(We have kept the minimum requirement for Mysql to 5.7 because since 2.2.7-1 version script was giving error while installing manually on mysql 5.6 Confirmed with vendor via email. They will soon update their docs ).
5. Keep Port Number, Database socket blank in Advanced Options for database in manual installation. Also uncheck 'Database connection uses SSL' and keep  'SSL CA certificate file path' blank. Even though script detects values for SCHLIX_DB_PORT and SCHLIX_DB_SOCKET and adds their entries (in config.inc.php) , even after keeping them blank in manual installation, keep their values blank in config.inc.php file. i.e define('SCHLIX_DB_PORT',''); and define('SCHLIX_DB_SOCKET','');(Tested in manual installation as well)
6. Download language files from "https://www.schlix.com/downloads/schlix-cms/system-language-packs/{{SCHLIX VERSION WITHOUT ._ }}/schlix-cms-syslangpack-{{LANGUAGE CODE}}-v{{SCHLIX VERSION}}.zip" and make ground zip from "system" folder ( link Mentioned in "system\apps\admin\admin.admin.class.php" in "installSystemLanguagePack" function )
